The significance of research in the training of graduate students requires no introduction \u2013 graduate studies are about research. Yet, it is useful to remember that the current scope of research activities (and the size of the graduate student body in the United States and elsewhere) are unprecedented. As one example, during the pe- riod 2000-17 the number of U.S. doctorates conferred annually increased from around 45,000 to 71,000 (a 57% increase). The number of U.S. Science and Engineering doctorates increased from around 28,000 to 46,000 (a 64% increase). These are very significant numbers, and a rate of growth that poses significant challenge for the U.S. R&D enterprise in the next 20 years."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Another way to look at academic R&D is to follow the money. In 2016 expenditures on academic R&D in the United States were $68.4 billion, of which the federal government funded 39 billion (57%) and the insti- tutions themselves about $18 billion (26%). The rest was funded by nonprofit organizations ($4.4 billion, 6.4%), businesses ($4.2 billion, 6.1%) and state and local government ($4 billion, 5.8%),. The bottom line is that more than 90% of academic R&D was paid \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 by the general public."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"How does funding and doctoral-student numbers correlate? From 2007 to 2016 higher education R&D expenditures in the United States have risen by 39% while the number of doctoral degrees awarded during the same period grew by only 15%. The number of Science and Education doctoral degrees grew at an even smaller rate, just 9.4%. Even when the expenditures are adjusted for inflation, higher education R&D expenses outpaced the number of doctoral degrees awarded. This phenomenon tells us what we should have known beforehand \u2013 that the costs of academic R&D, which include salaries of mentors and professors, equipment, research facilities and operating costs, are growing fast. So far the public \u2013 which funds about 90% of these expenses as we have seen \u2013 was willing to pay these escalating costs, but for how much longer and at what pace is an open question. We can all cite the success stories resulting from public funding of R&D at universities \u2013 the new effective drugs that were developed based on university research; new devices and techniques for communication, transpor- tation, environmental protection, medical diagnostics, pharmaceutics, and medical care; new, more efficient methods for manufacturing and logistics; strengthening of the public infrastructure. We use these success stories to justify what we do and to motivate ourselves."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Yet, there is also much skepticism by the public that funds us about the value of academic R&D. Signs\nof this skepticism include massive cuts to science and medicine research in the 2018 U.S. budget proposed by\nthe U.S. President. Among other important R&D organizations, this budget draft decimated the National Insti- tutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. While the proposed cuts were eventually reversed by Congress, the fact that they were suggested in the first place is a bad sign \u2013 we may see more of the tendency to cut science and engineering funding by public representatives, especially if the U.S. economy \u2013 that had been in a moderate to good course in the last few years \u2013 changes direction."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Between 1975 and 1988 U.S. Senator William Proxmire gave out the so-called \u201cGolden Fleece Awards.\u201d These were tongue-in-cheek \u201cawards\u201d presented to public officials in the United States for their squandering of public money. Unfortunately, many of these \u201cawards\u201d were given to university researchers for their projects and studies. In most cases, the reason for the dubious honor was either that the Senator and his colleagues did not understand what the research was about, or that the research was unsuccessful. We all know that unsuccessful\nresearch is part of our enterprise. When you start a new research effort you are taking a risk that your hypoth- eses and expectations will falter.

Most importantly, we should be capable and willing to explain to our funders and to the public what we do with their money.
